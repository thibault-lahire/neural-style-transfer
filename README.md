# Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project is an overview of neural style transfer, and was done with Clément Chadebec during the MVA course "Introduction à l'imagerie numérique", taught by Julie Delon and Yann Gousseau. After introducing the previous attempts of doing style transfer, we give details on CNNs and the neural style transfer process to eventually challenge the algorithm. We have also tested neural style transfer on videos. Enjoy!
